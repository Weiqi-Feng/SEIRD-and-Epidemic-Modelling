# Epidemic dynamics in SEIRD
This is the weekly note for my project in Trinity Term 2025 at the University of Oxford. The topic is modelling epidemic dynamics using SEIRD model in aid of policy making and disease control.

## Week One: SEIRD Models
The task in week one is to learn, code up and fully understand the SEIRD model. See [1_SEIRD](1_SEIRD) folder.

## Week Two: Inference
We look at the inverse problem in week two. Given noisy data, we first find the optimal or maximum likelihood values of the parameters, and then use an MCMC sampling method to estimate the posterior distribution of these parameters, both using [PINTS](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/main/examples/stats/beginners-tutorial.ipynb). See [2_Inference](2_Inference) folder.
