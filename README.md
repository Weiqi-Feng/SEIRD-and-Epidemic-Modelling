# Epidemic dynamics in SEIRD
This is the weekly note for my project in Trinity Term 2025 at the University of Oxford. The topic is modelling epidemic dynamics using SEIRD model in aid of policy making and disease control.

## Week 1: SEIRD Models
The task in week one is to learn, code up and fully understand the SEIRD model. See [1_SEIRD](1_SEIRD) folder.

## Week 2: Inference
In week two, We look at the inverse problem of finding the posterior distribution of parameters, by fitting noisy data to the model and using [PINTS](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/main/examples/stats/beginners-tutorial.ipynb). See [2_Inference](2_Inference) folder.

## Week 3/4/5: Spatial Heterogeneity
In the following weeks, we try to reproduce the results of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04648): use the synthetic data generated by Epiabm to assess the performance of SEIR model under spatially heterogeneous setting. There are three main steps:
1. EpiGeoPop: Generate standardized pupolation configuration for Epiabm input.
2. Epiabm: Agent-based model for simulation under spatially heterogeneous environment and intervention.
3. Seirmo: SEIR model inference. (TO DO)
